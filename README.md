# Wrench lab works

[Wrench](https://github.com/ryukzak/wrench) is an educational project designed to explore different types of processor
architectures. It includes simple CPU models and assemblers for them.

Work completed on these three architectures:

- [acc32](https://github.com/ryukzak/wrench/blob/master/docs/acc32.md)
- [f32a](https://github.com/ryukzak/wrench/blob/master/docs/f32a.md)
- [risc-iv-32](https://github.com/ryukzak/wrench/blob/master/docs/risc-iv.md)
- [m68k](https://github.com/ryukzak/wrench/blob/master/docs/m68k.md)

- big_to_little_endian
- capital_case_cstr
- capital_case_pstr
- count_divisors
- count_leading_zeros
- count_ones
- count_trailing_zeros
- count_zero
- fibonacci
- gcd
- hello_user_cstr
- hello_user_pstr
- is_binary_palindrome
- is_prime
- little_to_big_endian
- reverse_bits
- reverse_string_cstr
- reverse_string_pstr
- sum_even_n
- sum_n sum_odd_n
- sum_of_digits
- sum_word_cstream
- sum_word_pstream
- upper_case_cstr
- upper_case_pstr
